## *A. puertoricana* vs. *A. galaica*

## *A. eleganta*

- DZMB 9337: *Acanthocope sp.* 2, manca stage (Pereonite 7 undeveloped), lack of dorsomedial spine on Pereonite 7 - lack of P7 DM spine on *A. eleganta* comparing to *A. galica* and *A. puertoricana* might be also due to undeveloped P7. Also spine shape (rounded / spiky) might also change through moulting, as 9337 has rounded DM spine on Pleotelson, which is clearly spikier on the holotype.
