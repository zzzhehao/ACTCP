## Phylogeny

- 18S and COI agree with each other (almost the same topology) - we don't have complex phylogenetic situation
- Relative position of *A. galatheae* and *A. unicornis* group are different in COI and 18S - does that necessarily mean something? Or is it because of the junk sequences? I will rerun with clean sequences and check with Jenna.
- A. puertoricana, A. galaica, A. eleganta are the same species - confirmed by COI, 18S, proteomics. Morphologies are also similar.
- I used the same sequences to run 18S Bayesian Tree (*Disconnectes* and *Syneurycope* as outgroup), but then I got a polytomy at the root of the rest taxa which can't confirm *Acanthocope* as monophyly. Although the branch supports are low, and the sequences are not partitioned.
- For publication, I probably need a more sophisticate Bayesian / ML tree with partitioned 18S analysis, I am still trying to figure out how to find the V (variable) regions to make the partition scheme. @raupach2009 did 18S evaluation in Munnopsidae level but they deleted the hypervariable region, I might try to recreate their alignment to find out the region they deleted, or might wrap things up and ask Jenna.

![**COI Bayesian Tree** 193, 178 are blasted to Homo sapiens, 107 is something else, the super long branch is Polychaete, I will omit them later. I did a quick look and I think that the polyphyly was a false alarm](assets/Phylogeny/COI_Bayesian.png)
